# Technical-Assessment-I

Following sever, router, index, controller approach.

Since it is a assement I have use localhost env.

Node server will run on port no 4000 and will connect to local mongodb port 27017/punithtask.

To start server use "node server.js" or "nodemon" command inside directory.
